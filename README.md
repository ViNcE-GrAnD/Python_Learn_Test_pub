## Using this Repository
This repository contains the downloadable source for Beginning Programming with Python for Dummies, 3rd Edition. The code is usable in both Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook, but was created for the most part in Google Colab. *Jupyter Notebook users may find it easier to simply download the source code as a ```.zip``` file and upload it into Jupyter Notebook.* The reason I have switched to Google Colab is to allow you to view and use the code from any device that supports an appropriate browser, even your tablet. One reader reportedly used a smartphone. Please contact [John Mueller](mailto:John@JohnMuellerBooks) if you have any problems with this site. You can find the complete source code archive as a ```.zip``` file on the website at http://www.johnmuellerbooks.com/source-code/. Any bugs or other issues in the book will be discussed on the blog at http://blog.johnmuellerbooks.com/.
